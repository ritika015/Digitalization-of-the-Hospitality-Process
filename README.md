# Digitalization-of-the-Hospitality-Process
A web application in python to faciliate digitalising the hospitality process for group accomodations . The application should allow users to upload two CSV files to efficiently allocate the rooms in hostel while ensuring group members with same id stay together and adhere to hostel capacities and gender specific accomodations. 
CSV file 1: Contains information about groups with a common ID.
            Each row represents a group, specifying the group ID, the number of members, and the gender (boys or girls).
            There can be various scenarios under the same registration ID: groups of different sizes such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 people or more; groups consisting only of boys or girls; 
            and groups containing both boys and girls under the same registration ID.
